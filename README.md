GitHub should automatically prompt what type of issue you want to submit and then autopopulate with a template we created specifically for various RAMIP issues. Fill out the template as thoroughly as possible. This will ensure the issue you found is well-documented and easy for others to identify.

### Available Templates

`post-processing` - The formatting of the dataset file is inconvenient or incompatible with other datasets, but the underlying data is unaffected.

`coordinate` - The coordinates for a dataset are incompatible with other datasets, improperly formatted, or corrupted, but the underlying variable data is unaffected.

`critical` - The underlying values of the dataset are biased, corrupted, or demonstrably incorrect.

`data-request` - A group of datasets are missing from the general repository.

`suggestion` - A suggestion to make to the RAMIP repository or wiki.

`blank-issue` - If none of these templates fit, use this template for a issue with just a simple text body.


## Tests
Python tests are available in `tests/` to be run on individual or multiple netCDF files. They do not catch all issues, but check for the most common ones. Check out `tutorial.ipynb` for how to use it.
